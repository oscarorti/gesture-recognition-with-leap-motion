# pae-gesture-recognition

## Project description

These repository is a part of a university's ( Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, UPC ) project where we are developing software to recognise gestures inside a car, aiming to a human-car interaction system.

## Installation

I recommend to prepare a Python2.7 virtual environment using venv or anaconda and install LeapMotion v2 SDK, then clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone
```

## Getting started

To run the application execute the main script using:
```bash
python2 gestureRecognition.py
```
